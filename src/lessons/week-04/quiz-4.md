# Week 4 Quiz

1. Complete this week's quiz in [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) by navigating to the appropriate link.
2. Export it as a pdf using the Google Chrome plugin: [https://gofullpage.com/](https://gofullpage.com/). This plugin
   will do multiple screen captures while scrolling through your document, and then stitch them into a pdf that you can
   download.
3. Upload the generated pdf to Anchor below.

> **Note:** Anchor submissions can occur at any time during the term, but it is **critical** that you upload all of your
> work to Anchor before the last day of the term. Gradescope submissions must be submitted before the deadline (or the
> late deadline, if applicable).
