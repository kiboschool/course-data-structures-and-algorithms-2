## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- recall the differences between arrays and linked data structures in terms of memory allocation, insertion, and deletion operations
- analyze algorithms for their efficiencies in terms of both time and space
- develop iterative and recursive algorithms that read and modify linked data structures
- apply Python's built-in data structures to efficiently solve problems

## What's due this week

- Nothing! Start working on the [primer assignment](/lessons/week-01/primer.html), which is due next week.
