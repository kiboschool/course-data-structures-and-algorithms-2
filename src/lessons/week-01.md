# Python and Data Structures Review

Welcome to week 1!

## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- recall the differences between arrays and linked data structures in terms of memory allocation, insertion, and deletion operations.
- analyze algorithms for their efficiencies in terms of both time and space.
- develop iterative and recursive algorithms that read and modify linked data structures.
- apply Python's built-in data structures to efficiently solve problems.

## What's due this week

- Week 1 Quiz (on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)), due Thursday before class starts
- Assignment 1, due Sunday
