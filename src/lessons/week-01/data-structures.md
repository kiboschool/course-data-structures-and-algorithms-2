# Data Structures

As we continue our study of data structures and algorithms, let's first think back to some of the concepts we learned in the previous course.

Before continuing our study of data structures and algorithms, let's first think back to what we have previously learned. In the previous data structures course, we learned about a few different *linear* data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

We think of arrays and linked lists as *building block* data structures; we often use them to implement other data structures with some kind of abstraction. For example, a *first-in, first-out* (FIFO) queue can be implemented using either an array or linked list. The same is true for a *last-in, first-out* (LIFO) stack.

How we choose to implement data structures, including deciding between using an array or a linked list, depends on what properties we are looking for and what *efficiency* is required. Check out the video below to remind yourself about these data structures and how they're related:
