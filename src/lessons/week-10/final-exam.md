* It will flag any activity such as closing the test, changing programs, switching tabs, etc. If you do this too many times, it will close the exam and you will not be able to continue. Once you start the exam, you should expect to stay on the exam page and complete each question without any interruptions or using your computer for anything else.
* It disables copy and paste during the test
