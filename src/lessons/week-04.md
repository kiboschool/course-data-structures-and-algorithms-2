# Dynamic Programming

Welcome to week 4!

## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Recognize the characteristics of problems that can be solved using dynamic programming
- Analyze the time and space complexity of dynamic programming solutions, and compare them to alternative approaches like brute force
- Implement dynamic programming solutions for problems exhibiting optimal substructure and overlapping sub-problems

## What's due this week

- Week 4 Quiz (on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)), due Thursday before class starts
- Start working on Assignment 3 (due next week)
