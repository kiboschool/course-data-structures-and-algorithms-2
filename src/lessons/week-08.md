# Advanced Algorithms

Welcome to week 8!

## Learning objectives

By the end of this week, you will be able to:

- Trace examples of quicksort, explain its usage as a divide-and-conquer algorithm, and analyze its average case running time
- Analyze and differentiate between naive string matching algorithms and more advanced algorithms such as Rabin Karp
- Formulate and solve linear programming problems
- Describe the concept of duality as it relates to optimization problems

## What's due this week

- Week 8 Quiz (on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)), due Thursday before class starts
