## Course Description

This course builds on Data Structures & Algorithms 1. Students will explore non-linear data structures, and implement and analyze advanced algorithms.

The course begins with a brief review of basic data structures and algorithms. Students learn about advanced data structures including heaps, priority queues, and hash tables. Students build on their knowledge of graph theory to implement graph algorithms, and explore topics like finding the shortest paths in graphs, and applications of algorithms in maps, social networks, and a host of real-life applications. Other key topics include: divide and conquer, recursion, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, computability theory, and case studies in algorithm design.

The course emphasizes big-picture understanding and practical problem-solving in preparation for technical interviews and professional practice. Students will solve common algorithmic problems, and optionally participate in mock interview sessions.

* Dynamic programming

## How the course works

There are multiple ways you'll learn in this course:

- Read and engage with the materials on this site
- Attend live class and complete the activities in class
- Answer practice exercises to try out the concepts
- Complete assignments and projects to demonstrate what you have learned

Active engagement is necessary for success in the course! You should try to
write lots of programs, so that you can explore the concepts in a variety of
ways.

You are encouraged to seek out additional practice problems outside of the
practice problems included in the course.

## Assessments

* Primer assignment: 10%
* Weekly assignments: 60%
* Midterm exam: 10%
* Weekly pre-class quizzes: 20%

## Important Notes

- Our main communication tool is Discord. You are fully responsible for checking Discord for announcements and updates.
- You are expected to attend all classes. If you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up on the material.
- You are expected to complete all assignments on time. However, we also understand that circumstances may arise that require you to submit assignments late. Check the [late submission policy](assessments.md#late-policy) for information on how late assignments are handled.
- Cheating is not tolerated. If you are caught cheating, you will be given a zero for the assignment and you will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee. Make sure you are familiar with the [Kibo School Academic Integrity Policy](assessments.md#academic-integrity). You are expected to follow the policy in all your work.
- Make sure you check the [Getting help](asking-for-help.md) for information on how to get help with the course.

## Tools

In this course, we are using these tools to work on code. If you haven't set up
your laptop and installed the software yet, follow the guide in
[https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides](https://github.com/kiboschool/setup-guides).

- **Github** is a website that hosts code. We'll use it as a place to keep our project and assignment code.
- **Github Classroom** is a tool for assigning individual and team projects on Github.
- **VSCode** is your code editor. It's where you'll write code to solve
  programming assignments. It also has an embedded terminal, where you can run
  Python to try out your code and test that it works.
- **Gradescope** is a grading platform. We'll use it to track assignment
  submissions and give you feedback on your work.
- **Woolf** is our accreditation partner. We'll track work there too, so that
  you get credit towards your degree.
