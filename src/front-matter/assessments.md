- Quizzes will be due at the end of each week.
- Submit each quiz in Gradescope, then submit a pdf of your quiz in Anchor

## Programming Assignments

During some weeks, you'll be given an assignment to test the new skills and
concepts you learned. The assignments will be challenging, and it's recommended
that you complete the material and practice problems before you start the
project each week.

There will be five assignments overall.

## Midterm Exam

There will be a midterm exam held during week 5 of the term, covering the material in weeks 1-4.

## Final Exam

There will be a final exam held during week 10 of the term, covering the material in weeks 6-9.

## Late Policy

Programming assignments can be submitted late under Kibo's late policy:

* Submissions within two weeks of the deadline incur a 10% penalty.
* Submissions beyond two weeks late incur a 20% penalty.

The final submission deadline is the last day of the academic term.

Note that the late policy only applies to programming assignments. Quizzes must be submitted before the live class each week, and no late submissions will be accepted. The midterm exam and final exam must be taken at the assigned time.

Students facing exceptional circumstances in terms of submitting work on time should immediately contact their Kibo advisor.
